Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project - Petar Prokic
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This README.MD repository contains the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".

About the raw data
------------------
The dataset being used can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. 
The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file.
The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.

The same holds for the training set.

About the script and the tidy dataset
-------------------------------------
I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together.
Prerequisites for this script:

1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted and..
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be availble in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

After merging testing and training, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.
This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
